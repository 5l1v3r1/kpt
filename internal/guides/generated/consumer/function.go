var FunctionGuide = `
When an operation requires more than just the schema, and data is necessary,
the dynamic logic can be built into a separate tool.
Functions bundle dynamic logic in container images and apply that logic to the
contents of a package -- modifying and validating package contents.

{{% pageinfo color="primary" %}}
Functions provide a common interface for writing programs to read and write
resources as data. This enables greater reuse and composition than when
configuration is itself represented as code. Functions may be written in any
language, or simply wrap other existing programs.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

{{< svg src="images/fn" >}}

Let’s look at the example of imperatively running a function to set a label
value.  The label-namespace image contains a program which will modify the 

  kpt fn run --image gcr.io/kpt-functions/label-namespace . -- label_name=color label_value=orange

Kpt read the resources from the package at “.”, provided them as input to
a container running ` + "`" + `gcr.io/kpt-functions/label-namespace` + "`" + `, and wrote the
resources back to the package.

This particular function ([label-namespace]) adds a label to all Namespace resources
provided to it.

Functions can address many types of workflows, including:

- Generate resources from some inputs (like client-side CRDs)
- Apply cross-cutting transformations (e.g., set a field on all resources that
  look like this)
- Validating resources conform to best practices defined by the organization
  (e.g., must specify tag as part of the image)

See the [functions catalog] for more examples of functions, and the
[function docs] for more details on writing functions.
